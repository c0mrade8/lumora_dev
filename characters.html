                        <h3 class="character-name">Sol</h3>
                        <div class="character-details">
                            <p>Sol grew up in a household where laughter was the antidote to hardship. 
                                Despite facing many personal challenges, he became the light in their community — 
                                always checking in, cheering up friends, and finding something beautiful in every day. 
                                Sol learned early that positivity isn't denial, but resilience in action. His warmth is genuine, 
                                and his hope contagious.</p>
                        </div>

                </div>

                        <h3 class="character-name">Luna</h3>
                        <div class="character-details">
                            <p>Luna spent years feeling like an outsider, often lost in thought and emotions. 
                                But that introspection led to deep empathy. After journaling through her own grief and anxiety, 
                                she became the quiet anchor for others. People say she “just gets it,” because she listens, 
                                not to respond, but to understand. Her comfort lies in silence, soft words, and meaningful presence.</p>

                        <div class="character-details">
                            <p>Zephyr was once dismissed as “too much” — too loud, too playful, too weird. 
                                But instead of shrinking, he leaned into joy as rebellion. Now, he spreads lightness 
                                like confetti. Whether it's bad puns, surprise notes, or spontaneous dance, Zephyr reminds us 
                                that healing doesn't always have to be heavy.</p>

                        <div class="character-details">
                            <p>Ember once burned out from trying to hold everything together — school, family, expectations. 
                                But instead of breaking, she learned to bend, rest, and rebuild. Now, Ember supports others in 
                                moments of fatigue and despair. Her strength isn't loud — it's quiet, smoldering, and persistent. 
                                A true embodiment of “you'll rise again.”</p>

                            <p>Terra grew up in a family of chaos — no routines, constant moves. That's why 
                                he built structure like a lifeline: planners, checklists, grounding rituals. 
                                What started as survival became wisdom. Terra teaches others how to find steadiness even when 
                                life feels like quicksand. They are your practical, go-to guide when you're lost.</p>

                            <p>Growing up as the caretaker of a parent who struggled with mental illness, 
                                Willow learned early how powerful small kindnesses could be. Now, she offer that same mindful 
                                care to others — through tea rituals, calming conversations, or guided breathing. 
                                Willow believes in soft spaces and gentle healing.</p>

                            <p>Always the one staring at the stars or sketching in the margins, Astra was often misunderstood 
                                as "too dreamy." But her vivid imagination helped them survive a chaotic upbringing. 
                                Now, she uses that same visionary spirit to help others see possibilities when life feels narrow. 
                                Astra believes that, imagination is not escape — it's transformation.</p>

                            <p>River used to fear change — new schools, breakups, identity shifts — until life threw 
                                her into deep waters repeatedly. She learned to swim not by resisting the current, 
                                but by flowing with it. River is now that calm presence beside you during transitions, 
                                helping you find your own strength, one ripple at a time.</p>

                            <p>Echo always felt other people's emotions deeply — sometimes too deeply. As a child, 
                                she would cry during sad commercials or mediate family fights. After learning boundaries 
                                and emotional literacy, Echo now uses their gift to validate and hold space for others. 
                                She doesn't try to fix you — she just sits with you, and that makes all the difference.</p>

                            <p>Axel grew up seeing people they loved being taken advantage of, emotionally or otherwise. 
                                He became the protector — first for others, then for themselves. Axel stands for boundaries, 
                                safety, and respect. His strength isn't controlling — it's about empowering others to say “no” 
                                and reclaim space. He is the friend who has your back, always.</p>

                            <p>Vega turned to painting and music when words failed. Her sketchbooks became safe spaces, 
                                and her favorite songs became her companions. Diagnosed with depression in her teen, 
                                she now advocate for healing through self-expression. Vega encourages others to pick up a pen, 
                                brush, or guitar and let the feelings out in colors and sounds.</p>

                            <p>Nova was always asking "why?" — why people feel the way they do, why life hurts, why healing 
                                takes time. This curiosity led him to therapy, to hiking solo trails, to philosophy books 
                                and art galleries. Nova believes that every person is an unfolding story, and he helps you 
                                discover the hidden, beautiful pages in yours.</p>
